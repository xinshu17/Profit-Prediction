# MSiA_400_G12
Repo for the team project of MSiA 400: Everything Starts with Data

## Weekly Updates: 

### Until Oct 14th 2022

**What we’ve done this week (up to Oct 14th):**

- Downloaded pgAdmin, connected to MSiA’s Postgres server, and explored pgAdmin.

- Created a private repository in GitHub through the MSiA organization and gave access to everyone in the team, the instructor and the TA.

- Created the tables in Postgres following the database schema and granted access to everyone in the team. 

- Tried to populate the dataset. We managed to populate 3 out of the 5 tables (strinfo, skstinfo and deptinfo), but encountered problems when populating skuinfo and transact due to uncleaned data (mainly observations using commas for a specific entry that are generating extra columns in some rows).  

- Started cleaning the tables that have messy data in the command line. 

**Plan for the next week (Oct 17th-21th):**

- Fix problems in tables skuinfo and transact using command line and/or Python and/or R and import all datasets into Postgres.

- Data exploration on the database and understand the meaning or relationship between each column.
Sample the dataset to find the most appropriate subsets. 

- Define ML questions. 

### Oct 15th - Oct 21st
